0.14 2016-04-23
    NEW FEATURES:
        - support for cpanm --installdeps .
        - local installations are just skipped now, instead of aborting the
          entire thing.
    BUG FIXES:
        - improving the parser so it handles UNKNOWN/NA outputs properly
          (distributions with no tests, etc).
        - support for explicit NOTESTS results.
        - reports are skipped when current/tested
          perl versions mismatch (Michael LaGrasta)

    OTHER:
        - improved some error messages with likely diagnostics.
        - significantly increased test coverage.

0.13  2015-04-19
    NEW FEATURES:
      - now cpanm-reporter understands the history file from other
        CPAN Testers' clients! It should work seamlessly, and you
        can disable it by passing the '--skip-history' (GARU)

0.12  2015-01-05
    NEW FEATURES:
      - new "--dry-run" option (PLICEASE)

    BUG FIXES:
      - supporting HTTPS (PLICEASE)

0.11  2014-06-24
    BUG FIXES:
      - Github #11 - Proper handling of vstrings on parser log (KENTNL)
      - Ignoring modules from the LOCAL user (PLICEASE)
      - Ignoring modules from the 'Local::' namespace (ETHER)
      - Avoid 'deep recursion' warning

    OTHER:
      - several more tests written.
      - documenting PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT behaviour on prompts.

0.10  2013-07-16
    NEW FEATURES:
      - new command line option, 'only' to enable just one
        dist, or a group of comma-separated dists, for reporting (BBUSS)
      - new command line option, 'exclude' to disable a dist, or
        a group of comma-separated dists, for reporting (BBUSS)

    BUG FIXES:
      - works even on systems that don't support symlinks.

    OTHER:
      - catch errors happening when trying to send the report, showing
        a nice error message instead of a confusing trace (BBUSS)

0.09  2013-05-18
    BUG FIXES:
      - prevents prompt from being affected by PERL_MM_USE_DEFAULT
        (thanks Marcel "hanekomu" Grünauer for reporting!)

    OTHER:
      - Metabase transport now marked as a dependency (previously it was
        only a recommendation). Some clients do not trust recommendations
        and the vast majority of cpanm-reporter users are probably
        sending stuff via Metabase anyway, so I rather "punish" the
        minority with an extra dependency than the majority with a runtime
        error :)
      - improved docs

0.08  2013-05-09
    BUG FIXES:
      - forced CTCC 0.06 to avoid Metabase id_file issues

0.07  2013-05-08
    NEW FEATURES:
      - new '--setup' option that configures and updates your CPAN Testers
        data for you, just like CPAN::Reporter does for 'cpan'!
        (this fixes RT#84799 and Github#2, thanks Maurice Mengel and Boris
         Däppen for reporting!)

    BUG FIXES:
      - fixed RT#84979 where cpanm-reporter crashed when the build.log file
        could not be found (thanks Nathan Glenn for reporting!)
      - recommends installing Test::Reporter::Transport::Metabase as well,
        since almost all testers want to report directly to the CPAN Testers
        servers. Fixes RT#84794 (thanks Mark Lawrence for reporting!)
      - forces dependency on version 0.05 of CPAN::Testers::Common::Client,
        which fixes RT#85112 (thanks Lars for reporting!)

    OTHER:
      - updated docs :)

0.06  2013-04-18
      - fixed issue where cpanm-reporter sometimes failed to
        find the user's metabase_id.json file (thanks aero

      - Added missing dep (File::stat)
