=head1 NAME

cpanm-reporter - send cpanm output to CPAN Testers

=head1 SETUP

New to CPAN Testers' reporting? No problem! Just run:

   > cpanm-reporter --setup

And we will walk you through everything you need :)

(if you already use L<CPAN::Reporter>, you can safely skip the setup)

=head1 USAGE

Call cpanm as you normally would:

   > cpanm Moose Catalyst::Runtime Data::Printer ...

then, just call cpanm-reporter:

   > cpanm-reporter

=head2 OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

   --version              Shows version number and exits

   --help                 Shows basic usage help and exits

   --build_dir=PATH       Where your build directory is, containing
                          each dist's subdir. Default: $HOME/.cpanm/latest-build

   --build_logfile=PATH   Where the build.log is. Default: $BUILD_DIR/build.log

   --verbose (or -v)      Extra output

   --quiet (or -q)        As little output as possible (voids -v)

   --setup                Sets up the CPAN Testers configuration for you

   --only=A::B,C::D,...   Only send reports for these modules

   --exclude=A::B,...     Not send reports for these modules


=head1 DESCRIPTION

This app properly parses the output of L<cpanm> (C<build.log>) to
automatically generate and send reports to the CPAN Testers database.

C<cpanm> has quickly become one of the most used CPAN clients out there, but
it doesn't come with a native way to generate and send test reports to the
CPAN Testers infrastructure. This standalone app is able to interact with
your cpanm after you install a module, and do that for you.


=head2 CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT

You can use configuration files with different names and locations by setting
the following environment variables:

=over 4

=item * PERL_CPAN_REPORTER_DIR

The base directory in which your 'C<config.ini>' file resides. Defaults to
your home directory (if you're using Linux or OS X) or to the 'my documents'
folder (if you're running Windows).

=item * PERL_CPAN_REPORTER_CONFIG

In case you don't want to change just the base directory but the entire file's
path and name, you can set this variable to point at the new 'config.ini' file.

=head1 CAVEATS

=over 4

=item * This is a standalone tool that reads cpanm's C<build.log> file,
meaning it can potentially be run any time after cpanm has done its thing.
As such, you must be cautious to only run this tool I<right after> you run
cpanm, otherwise your whole environment may have changed, rendering the
report useless - maybe even turning it into a disservice.

B<< As such, we will *only* parse build.log files last modified up to 30
minutes before. >> You can override this by passing the C<--force> flag
to cpanm-reporter, but please take good care to avoid sending bogus reports.


=item * cpanm currently does B<not> record the output into your build.log file
if you pass the "verbose" argument to it, either C<--verbose> or C<-v>. If
you used those when installing dists, C<cpanm-reporter> won't find anything
to send :(

=item * cpanm-reporter is an external, auxiliary tool to cpanm. Since they're
not attached, you must take care not to change perls or local-libs between
installing distributions with C<cpanm> and generating/sending the reports with
C<cpanm-reporter>. If you're not a power user, you don't have to worry about
this. Just remember to run cpanm-reporter immediately after cpanm and
everything will be fine :)
